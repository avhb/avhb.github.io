Welcome to my personal website, this is a place where I intend to share about myself, my interests and general things that come to my mind.

If you want to know more about me, check out the [About]({{< ref "/about" >}} "About me") page.

The website has 2 sections at the moment.

1. [Blog](/blog): Posts about life and things in my areas of interest.
2. [Lists](/lists): Personal reccomendation lists for various topics (books, films, music I like...).
