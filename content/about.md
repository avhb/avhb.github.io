# Arne Vanheesbeke

I am a 20-something Test Engineer, based in Kortijk, Belgium.

## Why I am creating this website

This website is a place where I intend to share what I learn, this is supposed to help me process the knowledge better and can serve as a reference for myself as well. Also as a directory of cool stuff I find, things I like (like books, films, interesting websitesâ€¦)

In the near future, I intend to share learnings about testing, my homelab, automation and other things.

Interests:

- Literature
- Transit
- Science/Technology
- Films
- History
