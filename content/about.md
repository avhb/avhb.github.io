# Arne Vanheesbeke

I am a 20-something Test Engineer, based in the beautiful city of [Kortijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kortrijk), Belgium.

## Why I am creating this website

This website is a place where I intend to share what I learn, this is supposed to help me process the knowledge better and can serve as a reference for myself as well.

In the near future, I intend to share learnings about testing and my homelab/homeserver.

The website has 2 sections at the moment.

- The testers toolchest

1. [Blog](/blog): Posts about life and things in my areas of interest.
2. [Lists](/lists): Personal reccomendation lists for various topics (books, films, music I like...).

Interests:
- Literature
- Transit
- Science/Technology
- Film
- History
