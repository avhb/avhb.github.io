Why I am creating this website This website is a place where I intend to share what I learn, this is supposed to help me process the knowledge better and can serve as a reference for myself as well. Also as a directory of cool stuff I find, things I like (like books, films, interesting websitesâ€¦)
In the near future, I intend to share learnings about testing, my homelab, automation and other things.</description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://avhb.github.io/blog/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 18:32:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://avhb.github.io/blog/first-post/</guid><description>Hello World ðŸ˜Ž Hello, this is a test post for my new website, it is generated using the Hugo static site generator.</description></item></channel></rss>
